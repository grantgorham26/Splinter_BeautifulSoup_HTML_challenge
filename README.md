The purpose of this mini project was to utilize webscraping to obtain data about from articles about Mars as well as scarpe table data about Mars. To do this I used beautifulsoup, splinter, pandas, numpy and then matplotlib in orded to create visualizations.


## part 1 scaraping Mars articles

To begin this part of the challenge I first imported splinter and beautifulsoup. Splinter was used to open a website and beautiful soup was used to parse and scrape the data from the website. Using beautifulsoup I scarped the titles and the preview text of multiple artuicles about Mars and then stored them as a list of dictionaries.
